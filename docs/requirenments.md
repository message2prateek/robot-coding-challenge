# Brief

You have a toy robot on a tabletop, a grid of 5 x 5 units, there are no obstructions. You can issue
commands to your robot allowing it to roam around the tabletop. But be careful, don't let it fall off!

Create an app that allows commands to be issued to the robot. The robot should be prevented from
failing off the tabletop to its destruction.

A failed command should not stop the app, valid commands should be allowed.

The application should discard all commands until a valid `place()` command has been executed.
0, 0 on the grid should be seen as bottom left.

## Input
Every command should provide visual output that the command has either succeeded or failed.
`place(x, y, facing)`
`x` and `y` are integers that relate to a location on the grid. Values that are outside the boundary of the grid should not be allowed.

facing is a string referencing the direction the robot is facing. Values `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST` or
`WEST` are allowed.

`move()`
Moves the robot 1 grid unit in the direction it is facing unless that movement will cause the robot to fall off the grid.

`left()`
Rotate the robot 90° anticlockwise/counterclockwise.

`right()`
Rotate the robot 90° clockwise.

`report()`
Outputs the robot's current grid location and facing direction.

## Output
place(0, 0, 'NORTH')
move()
report() => Output: 0, 1, NORTH
place(0, 0, NORTH)
left()
report() => Output: 0, 0, WEST
place(1, 2, EAST)
move()
move()
left()
move()
report() => Output: 3, 3, NORTH
